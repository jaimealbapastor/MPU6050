MPU-6050 Arduino Library

The goal of this 12h project is to create an arduino library allowing simple communication with the MPU-6050 by applying the math learned in Robotics & Sensor Fusion. This library will later be of use when creating our own [Cubli](https://youtu.be/n_6p-1J551Y?si=313eOARQMZ9kTAT7).
